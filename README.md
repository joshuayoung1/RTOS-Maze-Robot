ECE 4437 Embedded Microcomputer Systems Spring 2018

This was a one semester project where I was expected to learn how to design the interface hardware to connect to various I/O decices to the microcontroller. Also I needed to be able to progarm the microcontroller to perform real-time I/O in an interrupt-driven multithreaded environment.During laboratory hours, I needed to know how to debug the hardware interface and real-time microcontroller programs using techniques learned in the course.
